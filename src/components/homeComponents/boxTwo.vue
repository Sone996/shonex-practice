                Pricing and discounts made up a portion of each insurer’s score, but we know that cost is the top factor for many auto insurance shoppers. Since pricing is based on personal factors including your age, location, vehicle and credit history and gender (in most cases), it’s important to shop around for car insurance quotes.
                <br><br>
                If price is the most important factor in your search, comparing car insurance quotes can help you find the cheapest rate. But your shopping experience will also shed light on a company’s customer service standards.

              <li>Visit your state insurance commissioner’s website to find complaints and other information about companies in your area.</li>
              <li>Ask your agent or a customer service representative any questions you have to make sure you’re getting all the coverage you need — and nothing you don’t want.</li>
              <li>Consider smaller insurance companies, too. Small companies offer rates well below large competitors in many locations.</li>
              <li>If you’ve had tickets, DUIs or other violations, be sure to shop three and five years after the incident, when surcharges can drop significantly.</li>
